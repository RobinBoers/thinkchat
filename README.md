ThinkChat is a simple chatting app using socketio. I wanted to learn how socketio worked, an this seemed like a cool project. It's discord themed and it has multiple rooms. I also plan to add voice-calling in the future (if I can figure out how to)

### Features

These are the features I plan on implementing.  
Some of them are finished, some of them aren't.

- Multiple rooms
- PWA
- Responsive design
- List to show people who are online
- LocalStorage to save username
- Random colord names
- theme switching (dark/light mode)
- voice-calling

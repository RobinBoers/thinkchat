# ThinkChat

ThinkChat is a simple chatting app using socketio. It's going to be a replacement for [Nindo Chat](https://github.com/RobinBoers/Nindo#nindo) on my website. It's discord themed and I plan on making multiple rooms.

NOTE: I added buttons for channels, but they aren't functional yet!

### Features

These are the features I plan on implementing.  
Some of them are finished, some of them aren't.

- Multiple rooms
- PWA
- Responsive design
- List to show people who are online
- Localstorage to save username
- Random colord names
- theme switching (dark/light mode)
